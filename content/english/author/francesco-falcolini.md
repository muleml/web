Physicist, with his head always among data, algorithms, and batteries. After a long career leading projects in banking, business, healthcare, and public administration, he founded muleML, where he serves as CEO. He believes predictive models should be explainable, useful, and sustainable â€” and when in doubt, he always prefers a concrete approach over a trendy buzzword.
