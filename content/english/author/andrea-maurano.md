Physicist and materials engineer, PhD at Imperial College London and post-doc at MIT in Boston. He worked as a researcher in the US at MIT, Samsung, and 24M labs, exploring batteries, photonics, and artificial intelligence. Back in Italy, he founded muleML — where he now serves as Scientific Advisor — with a simple goal: making energy more reliable and sustainable, and proving that even the most complex research can still have a smiling face.
