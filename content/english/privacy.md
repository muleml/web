### What are cookies
Cookies are small text files that websites visited by users send to their terminals, where they are stored to then be retransmitted to the same websites during subsequent visits. Cookies allow, for example, navigation preferences to be saved and the browsing experience improved.  

There are also cookies installed by domains other than the one visited by the user (“third-party cookies”), for example when the page includes external elements such as videos, maps, or social buttons.

### Types of cookies used

##### Technical cookies
These are essential for the website to function and do not require user consent.  
They include:  
- session or navigation cookies, which ensure correct website use;  
- functionality cookies, which allow user choices (e.g. language) to be remembered;  
- **anonymized** analytics cookies (e.g. aggregated statistics without directly identifying the user).
