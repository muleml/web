### About us
We are an innovative company developing advanced solutions for the intelligent management of energy storage systems (BESS). We work at the intersection of energy, data, and artificial intelligence, with an open-source, scalable, and sustainable approach.

### Role
We are looking for a Data & Software Engineer who will contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of a modular, containerized platform for collecting, semantically harmonizing, and analyzing data from BESS and microgrids. The role will involve both technical development and functional evolution of the solution, working closely with multidisciplinary teams of engineers, data scientists, and researchers.

### Responsibilities
* Design and implement data ingestion and transformation pipelines from IoT sensors and devices (MQTT, OPC-UA, Modbus, etc.).
* Develop and maintain containerized architectures (Docker/Podman) for on-premise, edge, and cloud deployments.
* Integrate and optimize real-time databases (time-series DB) and analytical data lakes (DuckDB, Parquet, Arrow).
* Implement semantic models (ontologies, NGSI-LD, SAREF) to ensure interoperability and enable digital twins.
* Develop user interfaces (dashboards, SPARQL endpoints, REST/GraphQL APIs) for accessing historical and real-time data.
* Collaborate with data scientists and modelers to enable simulations, forecasting, and energy optimization algorithms.
* Manage CI/CD processes, testing, and validation in both simulated and real environments.
* Ensure technical documentation and contribute to the open-source release of developed modules.

### Requirements

1. Degree in Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, or related fields.  
2. Experience in software development (Python, SQL, Typescript/React).  
3. Knowledge of data-driven architectures, IoT, and microservices.  
4. Familiarity with FIWARE/Orion-LD, MQTT, IoT Agents, or similar frameworks.  
5. Experience with analytical databases and data lake technologies (DuckDB, Arrow, Parquet).  
6. Knowledge of semantic web concepts, ontologies, and data modeling.  
7. Experience with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Linux environments.  
8. Ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary and international teams.  

### Nice to have

* Experience in energy, smart grids, or BESS systems.  
* Knowledge of machine learning techniques and MLOps.  
* Contributions to open-source projects.  

### What we offer

* Opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge solutions for smart energy.  
* A dynamic, innovation-driven environment with strong ties to research and open-source.  
* Technical and professional growth opportunities in a rapidly expanding sector.  
* Flexible work arrangements (hybrid/remote).
